[Contiv-VPP](https://contivpp.io/) is a CNI plugin for Kubernetes that employs
a programmable [CNF vSwitch](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) based on [FD.io VPP](https://fd.io/)
offering feature-rich, high-performance cloud-native networking and services.

For more details see [https://contivpp.io/](https://contivpp.io/)

* support for [multiple interfaces per pod](docs/operation/CUSTOM_POD_INTERFACES.md), including memif interfaces
* support for [multiple isolated L2 or L3 networks](k8s/examples/custom-network/README.md)
* [IPv6 support](docs/setup/IPV6.md), segment routing implementation of k8s services ([SRv6](docs/setup/SRV6.md))

## Documentation
The [docs folder](docs) contains lots of documentation. For the beginning, you can start with:
* [ARCHITECTURE](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for high-level description of Contiv-VPP
  components and operation,
* [NETWORKING](docs/NETWORKING.md) for detailed description on how the network
  is programmed with Contiv-VPP,
* [DEVELOPER GUIDE](docs/dev-guide) for details on how Contiv-VPP works internally.


## Quickstart
You can get started with Contiv-VPP in one of the following ways:
* Use the [Contiv-VPP Vagrant Installation](vagrant/README.md) instructions to start a
  simulated Kubernetes cluster with a couple of hosts running in VirtualBox
  VMs. This is the easiest way to bring up a cluster for exploring the
  capabilities and features of Contiv-VPP.

* Use the [Contiv-specific kubeadm install](docs/setup/MANUAL_INSTALL.md)
  instructions to manually install Kubernetes with Contiv-VPP networking on one
  or more bare-metal servers.

* Use the [Arm64-specific kubeadm install](docs/arm64/MANUAL_INSTALL_ARM64.md)
  instructions to manually install Kubernetes with Contiv-VPP networking on one or more
  bare-metal servers of Arm64 platform.

* Use the [Calico-VPP Vagrant](vagrant/calico-vpp/README.md) to explore deployment of VPP
  in Calico clusters, where some of the nodes can be running plain Calico (without VPP)
  and some of the nodes can be running Calico with VPP.

* Try [Contiv-VPP UI](ui/README.md) web browser user interface on top of Contiv-VPP,
  it runs in Vagrant deployments as well as on bare-metal.
